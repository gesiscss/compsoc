# ``compsoc`` – Computational Social Methods in Python (alpha)

**Description**: ``compsoc`` – *Notebooks for Computational Sociology* is a toolkit that tries to lower the hurdles of using digital behavioral data and computational methods. Digital behavioral data (e.g., from digital platforms or recorded via social sensors) provides new opportunities for computational social science because it is voluminous, dynamic, and rich. The tools provided are aimed at unlocking this potential. Start the toolkit by clicking on the "launch binder" button.
