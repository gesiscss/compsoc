**Description**: ``compsoc`` – *Notebooks for Computational Sociology* is a web-based toolkit that tries to lower the hurdles of using digital behavioral data and computational methods for social scientists. Behavioral data is transactional in nature which makes it a prime source for studies of social and cultural structures and dynamics. Provided tools aim at fostering mechanistic understanding of observed behaviors and patterns. Currently, the kit is restricted to the Python programming language.
